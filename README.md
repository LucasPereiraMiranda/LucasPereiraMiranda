## 💻 A little more about me

I’m passionate about creating smart and scalable software solutions. While my focus is on backend technologies, I’m diving more into frontend as well.

I love working with **microservices**, **serverless**, **message brokers**, **queues**, **cloud providers**, and constantly learning new tools to keep improving. Always staying curious!

Outside of coding, I’m into anime, movies, and hanging out with pets. 😄
